For a manager to effectively monitor employee activity, whether they are on leave, in the office, or working from home (WFH), it's important to implement a structured system that captures and analyzes attendance data.

## Problem statement
* Calculate the percentage of employees who visit the office.
* Calculate the percentage of employees who are working from home.
* Calculate the percentage of employees who are taking sick leaves.

Helps keep track of which day is best for conducting a meeting and to take any calls in the office, this also helps the manager to know what percentage of employees visit on a particular day. It also gives a good idea of which weeks in the month can have less workforce so that they can manage the work effectively and also keep track of employees who have less attendance rate.

This dashboard is built using Power BI which helps the manager to track all mentioned above, also this dashboard is dynamic in nature and changes from time to time with the data that is given as input.
